# USYD-Study-Space-App
This iOS app is designed to allow USYD students to search for an empty room to study so that students don't have to struggle to find a place in overcrowded library. Ideally, this app will help ultilising the resources in university such as unoccupied tutuorial rooms and lecture theatres. 

# Cool! How to install it?
The app is unfortunatly not available on App Store at the moment due to data were scraped from USYD and I'm not commited to subscribe to Apple Developer Program yet.

To install it, you needs:
  1. A MacOS installed mac/computer.
  2. Xcode.
  3. An apple account to sign in on Xcode.
