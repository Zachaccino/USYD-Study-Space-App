# USYD-Study-Space-App
This iOS app is designed to allow USYD students to search for an empty room to study so that students don't have to struggle to find a place in overcrowded library. Ideally, this app will help ultilising the resources in university such as unoccupied tutuorial rooms and lecture theatres.
